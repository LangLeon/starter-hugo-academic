I am a PhD student at the University of Amsterdam, interested in information theory, equivariant deep learning, and pure mathematics more generally.
More recently, I got very interested in AI alignment. You can find my alignment-related writing [on Lesswrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/leon-lang).
