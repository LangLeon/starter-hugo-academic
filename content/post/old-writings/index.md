## Theses

In July 2020, I finished my {{< staticref "uploads/thesis.pdf" "newtab" >}}master's thesis artificial intelligence{{< /staticref >}} at the University of Amsterdam. It contains a generalization of the Wigner-Eckart theorem from quantum mechanics. Compared with the adapted {{< staticref "publication/2021-a-lang" >}}ICLR publication{{< /staticref >}}, this thesis features an alternative introduction and a more detailed literature review.

In October 2017, I finished my {{< staticref "uploads/master_thesis_abgabe_version.pdf" "newtab" >}}master's thesis mathematics{{< /staticref >}} at the university of Bonn. This thesis details the asymptotic behaviour of so-called Auslander-Reiten translations, which are functors in the representation theory of finite dimensional associative algebras.

In August 2015, I handed in my {{< staticref "uploads/Torische_Varietaeten_Abgabe_version.pdf" "newtab" >}}bachelor's thesis mathematics{{< /staticref >}} at the university of Heidelberg. In there, I explain what toric varieties are in the modern language of schemes. I then explain that the category of normal, separated toric varieties is equivalent to that of so-called finite fans.


## Seminar Expositions from my mathematics bachelor's degree

The following texts are written additions to talks I gave seminars for my bachelor's studies in mathematics. All of them are in German.

{{< staticref "uploads/Der Okasche Kohaerenzsatz.pdf" "newtab" >}}der Okasche Kohärenzsatz{{< /staticref >}}, December 2014.

{{< staticref "uploads/Ausarbeitung - Satz von Max Noether.pdf" "newtab" >}}Der Satz von Max Noether{{< /staticref >}}, October 2014.

{{< staticref "uploads/Affine Varietäten.pdf" "newtab" >}}Affine Varietäten{{< /staticref >}}, July 2014.

{{< staticref "uploads/seminar_reihen.pdf" "newtab" >}}Die Eulersche Summationsformel{{< /staticref >}}, June 2013.
