abstract: Group equivariant convolutional networks (GCNNs) endow classical convolutional
  networks with additional symmetry priors, which can lead to a considerably improved
  performance. Recent advances in the theoretical description of GCNNs revealed that
  such models can generally be understood as performing convolutions with G-steerable
  kernels, that is, kernels that satisfy an equivariance constraint themselves. While
  the G-steerability constraint has been derived, it has to date only been solved
  for specific use cases - a general characterization of G-steerable kernel spaces
  is still missing. This work provides such a characterization for the practically
  relevant case of G being any compact group. Our investigation is motivated by a
  striking analogy between the constraints underlying steerable kernels on the one
  hand and spherical tensor operators from quantum mechanics on the other hand. By
  generalizing the famous Wigner-Eckart theorem for spherical tensor operators, we
  prove that steerable kernel spaces are fully understood and parameterized in terms
  of 1) generalized reduced matrix elements, 2) Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, and 3)
  harmonic basis functions on homogeneous spaces.
